        <h3>First Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of doing God's will in your life</i></p>

        <p>
            <i>Luke 1: 26-38</i> <br>
            In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
            to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.
            And coming to her, he said, “Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you.”
            But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
            Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you 
            will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be 
            called Son of the Most High,* and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
            and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
            But Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?”
            And the angel said to her in reply, “The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High
             will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.
            And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month 
            for her who was called barren;for nothing will be impossible for God.”
            Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.” Then the 
            angel departed from her.

        <h3>Second Joyful Mystery: The Visitation</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of doing charity for the poor</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 1: 39-56</i> <br>
            During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah,where she entered 
            the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, 
            and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, “Most blessed are you among women, 
            and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
            For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed are you 
            who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.”
            And Mary said:
            “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;
            my spirit rejoices in God my savior.
            For he has looked upon his handmaid’s lowliness;
            behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed.
            The Mighty One has done great things for me,
            and holy is his name.
            His mercy is from age to age
            to those who fear him.
            He has shown might with his arm,
            dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.
            He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones
            but lifted up the lowly.
            The hungry he has filled with good things;
            the rich he has sent away empty.
            He has helped Israel his servant,
            remembering his mercy,
            according to his promise to our fathers,
            to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”
            Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.

        <h3>Third Joyful Mystery: The Nativity</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of visiting Jesus' real presence in every time of your day</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 2: 1-20</i> <br>
            In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be enrolled.This was the first 
            enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town. And Joseph too 
            went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he 
            was of the house and family of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. While they were 
            there, the time came for her to have her child, and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling 
            clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. Now there were shepherds in that 
            region living in the fields and keeping the night watch over their flock. The angel of the Lord appeared to them and 
            the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with great fear. The angel said to them, “Do not be 
            afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For today in the city of 
            David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find an infant 
            wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the 
            angel, praising God and saying: “Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”When 
            the angels went away from them to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go, then, to Bethlehem to see this 
            thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.” So they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph, and 
            the infant lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known the message that had been told them about this child.
            All who heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds. And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on 
            them in her heart. Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it 
            had been told to them.

        <h3>Fourth Joyful Mystery: The Presentation</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of receiving the Holy Spirit in your life</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 2: 22-38</i> <br>
            When the days were completed for their purification* according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present 
            him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,”
            and to offer the sacrifice of “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,” in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.
            Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and 
            the holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the 
            Messiah of the Lord. He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom 
            of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying: “Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, 
            according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a light for revelation 
            to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.” The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon 
            blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign 
            that will be contradicted (and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.” There was also
            a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived seven years with her husband 
            after her marriage, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting 
            and prayer. And coming forward at that very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption 
            of Jerusalem.

        <h3>Fifth Joyful Mystery: The Finding of Jesus in the Temple</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of the conversion of all sinners to return back to our Lord</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 2: 41-52</i> <br>
            Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, and when he was twelve years old, they went up according to festival 
            custom. After they had completed its days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.
            Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, 
            they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to 
            them and asking them questions, and all who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were 
            astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.” 
            And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he 
            said to them. He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus
            advanced [in] wisdom and age and favor before God and man.
